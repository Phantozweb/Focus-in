                answer: "Focus.Ai is designed as a learning aid to help students understand how to interpret clinical findings. While it is trained on extensive optometry data, it is not a diagnostic tool and is not 100% accurate. It should be used as a supplementary study resource to develop your clinical reasoning skills, not to make definitive diagnoses."

It allows you to generate, edit, and organize comprehensive study guides, lecture notes, and summaries directly within the platform. You can ask the AI to create content on a topic and then refine it to fit your study needs."

It mimics the lens-flipping process and patient responses, allowing you to practice and refine your refraction skills in a gamified, risk-free environment. It's an excellent tool for building muscle memory and confidence before you work with real patients."

                question: "Is my patient data stored anywhere?",

             {
                question: "How does this help me prepare for viva exams?",

The AI will ask you relevant questions about the case, from patient history to diagnosis and management, just like a real examiner would. It's a great way to practice your clinical reasoning and communication skills under pressure."

            {
                question: "Why do I need to practice transposition?",
                answer: "Transposition is a fundamental skill in optometry used to convert prescriptions between plus and minus cylinder forms. Being fast and accurate is essential for both exams and clinical practice. Focus Gen helps you build that speed and confidence."
